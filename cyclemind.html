<h2>About CycleMind</h2>

<p class="Aboutme"> CycleMind is a Jordan-based fitness company with studios in 2 around the country. Founded in 2016, it offers indoor cyclying workout classes.</p>

<p> In 2012, <?php
$name = "Faher Elfayez";
echo $name;


?> moved to the United States from her hometown, Amman, where she discovered her passion for health and fitness. She had a full time job as a PR professional and was doing her master's degree at night. Her days were extremely hectic and busy. Her only escape was her 6 a.m. workouts. She would try different classes but found herself loving and benefiting from any activity that would keep her heart rate up. Spinning and HITT workouts became her favorite two workouts. She was visiting her family in Amman in 2016 and after a big feast at home, she wanted to do a good workout in Amman. She looked for a spin class and found out that there were none. She decided she wanted to share her passion for such workout with other Jordanians and started the first spin studio in <?php
$city = "Amman, Jordan";

?> .</p>
